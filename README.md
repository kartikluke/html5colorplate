<h1> INTRO </h1>
HTML 5 Colorplate is a dynamic HTML/LESS(CSS) template generator that creates an entire web design framework based on 
a color combination. This color combination is generated via a user input search string and harnesses the power of 
SAX and Adobe Kuler. The framework is based on HTML5Boilerplate and can be easily integrated with Bootstrap.

We're still in BETA so excuse the bugs and do keep us informed if you encounter anything undocumented!:)
